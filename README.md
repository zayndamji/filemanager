# File Manager

An encrypted file manager for the Web and iOS.  
The Web version is available at https://files.zayndamji.dev and the source code is in the /FileManager directory.  
The iOS source code is in the /FileManagerNative directory. It could theoretically support Android, but that hasn't been tested.  

Completely client-side. No requests outside of the app(s). All data is encrypted.
